Gradescope Autograder Tools and Scripts

---

## Repository Moved

To better enable continued work on these Gradescope Tools, active development is moving to [knightRider0xD/gs-tools](https://github.com/knightRider0xD/gs-tools).

These tools will remain open source.

This repository contains tools and scripts for Gradescope autograders.  
The following tools are currently included:

- **libs/GradescopeResult.hpp** A C++ library for generating a Gradescope test result
- **tools/generate_results** Combines multiple test results to generate correctly formatted content for results.json
- **tools/merge_results** Combines multiple test results into a single test result
- **tools/cap_part_results** For groups of tests with a maximum score for that group, offsets the total score to not exceed the maximum
- **tools/nbgrader-to-gs** Extracts results from a graded NBGrader .ipynb notebook. See releases for an integrated example.
- **tools/apply_late_policy** Adjusts final mark of late submissions according to a late policy.
- **tools/append_output** Appends additional text to the body of test result. Useful if the score and output are collected separately.
- **tools/gs-message** Creates a non-graded result for displaying informational or error messages.

These tools are mainly written using Node.js due to its native JSON support.  
More tools on their way!
